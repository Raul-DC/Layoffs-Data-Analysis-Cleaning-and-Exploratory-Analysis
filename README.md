## Introduction

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85fecb70-58de-495c-abb0-ed8cda3c9123)

In this project, raw data regarding global layoffs is first processed through a robust data cleaning workflow. After cleaning the data, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to reveal key insights about trends, distribution of layoffs by company, industry, country, and time intervals. The project simulates a real-world data pipeline‚Äîfrom raw data ingestion and preparation to a refined analytical reporting stage.

## Data Cleaning Process 

üßπ This section summarizes the steps followed to clean and standardize the dataset:

1. **üì¶ Database & Table Setup:**  
   - Initialize MySQL Workbench and create a new schema (named `world_layoffs`).
   - Use the Table Data Import Wizard to load the dataset into a working table.
   - Create a duplicate staging table to work on data without altering the original.

2. **üö´ Removal of Duplicates:**  
   - Execute queries using `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (...)` partitioning by key columns (company, location, etc.) to identify duplicate records.

   *(Detection of duplicates)*

   - Apply a Common Table Expression (CTE) for detecting duplicates and then remove rows with `row_num > 1`.

  *We need to create a second staging table first*
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE   `layoffs_staging2` (
	`company` text,
	`location` text,
	`industry` text,
	`total_laid_off` int DEFAULT NULL,
	`percentage_laid_off` text,
	`date` text,
	`stage` text,
	`country` text,
	`funds_raised_millions` int DEFAULT NULL,
	`row_num` int
	) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
   ```
*Now we can proceed to copy the data*
 ```sql
INSERT INTO layoffs_staging2
	SELECT *,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
	PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions
	) AS row_num
	FROM layoffs_staging;
```

*And now at last, we can delete the duplicates*
```sql
DELETE FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE row_num >1;
```

3. **üíæ Data Standardization:**
   
   - Trim strings and correct inconsistencies in text fields (e.g., standardizing multiple versions of "Crypto" and handling punctuation in country names).
     
   ```sql
   UPDATE layoffs_staging2
	  SET company = TRIM(company);
   ```

   ```sql
   UPDATE layoffs_staging2
	  SET industry = 'Crypto'
  	WHERE industry LIKE 'Crypto%';
   ```

   ```sql
   UPDATE layoffs_staging2
	  SET country = TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM country)
  	WHERE country LIKE 'United States%';
   ```

   - Convert date strings into a proper date format using `STR_TO_DATE` and update the schema to switch the column type accordingly.

   ```sql
   SELECT `date`,
	  STR_TO_DATE(`date`, '%m/%d/%Y')
	  FROM layoffs_staging2;
   ```

   ```sql
   UPDATE layoffs_staging2
	  SET `date` = STR_TO_DATE(`date`, '%m/%d/%Y')
   ```

   

5. **üí¨ Handling NULLs and Blank Values:**
   
   - Identify and inspect NULL or blank values in key columns.

   *There we saw the nulls*
   ```sql
   SELECT *
	  FROM layoffs_staging2
  	WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL;
   ```

   *There we saw which industries are blank or nulls*
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT industry
	  FROM layoffs_staging2;
   ```

   *We found correlations among companies with null values*
   ```sql
   SELECT *
	  FROM layoffs_staging2
	  WHERE industry IS NULL
	  OR industry = '';
   ```
   *We gave a closer look at Airbnb's values*
   ```sql
   SELECT *
  	FROM layoffs_staging2
	  WHERE company = 'Airbnb';
   ```
   
   - Convert empty values to Null values for manipulation

   ```sql
   UPDATE layoffs_staging2
	  SET industry = NULL
	  WHERE industry = '';
   ```

   - Update records by joining duplicate entries, ensuring that missing information is populated with valid values wherever possible.
  
   ```sql
   UPDATE layoffs_staging2 t1
	  JOIN layoffs_staging2 t2
		 ON t1.company = t2.company
  	SET t1.industry = t2.industry
	  WHERE (t1.industry IS NULL OR t1.industry = '')
	  AND t2.industry IS NOT NULL;
   ```

   - Remove uninformative rows where critical numeric fields (e.g., total layoffs) are missing.

   ```sql
   DELETE
  	FROM layoffs_staging2
	  WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
	  AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;
   ```

7. **üóëÔ∏è Removal of Unnecessary Columns:**  
   - Drop helper columns (e.g., the temporary `row_num`) to streamline the final dataset.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
  	DROP COLUMN row_num;
   ```

   - Verify the cleaned dataset with a final SELECT statement.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM layoffs_staging2
   ```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

üîé With the cleaned dataset in place, the next phase is to perform an exploratory analysis to extract actionable insights:

1. **üëì Initial Data Examination:**

   - Run queries to display the overall dataset.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM layoffs_staging2
   ```

   - Use aggregate functions like `MAX()`, `MIN()` to understand the range of values in key fields such as `total_laid_off` and `percentage_laid_off`.

   ```sql
   SELECT MAX(total_laid_off), MAX(percentage_laid_off)
   FROM layoffs_staging2;
   ```

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f136a01-aa41-46e2-b8d7-cea9e4097e78)


   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM layoffs_staging2
   WHERE percentage_laid_off = 1
   ORDER BY total_laid_off DESC;
   ```

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f25dec4a-3ce4-454e-b658-e248c599c13b)
 
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM layoffs_staging2
   WHERE percentage_laid_off = 1
   ORDER BY funds_raised_millions DESC;
   ```

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ab03cda-081b-4f74-b7ea-7d2c5f59d324)


2. **üè¢ Analysis by Company:**  

   - Group data by company to compute the sum of layoffs.

   ```sql
   SELECT company, SUM(total_laid_off)
   FROM layoffs_staging2
   GROUP BY company
   ORDER BY 2 DESC;
   ```

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36e1323f-6189-4729-be00-55db90b8d1bd)

   - Identify companies that have experienced 100% workforce reduction.
  
   ```sql
   SELECT company, percentage_laid_off, total_laid_off
   FROM layoffs_staging2
   WHERE percentage_laid_off = 1
   ORDER BY total_laid_off DESC;
   ```

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fe3cf8d-e366-4fd4-aa22-dc27820babaf)


3. **üè≠ Industry Analysis:**
    
   - Aggregate layoffs by industry to pinpoint which sectors are most affected.

   ```sql
   SELECT industry, SUM(total_laid_off)
   FROM layoffs_staging2
   GROUP BY industry
   ORDER BY 2 DESC;
   ```

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be47dbc3-91e4-4382-8426-b25382688015)



4. **üåé Country Analysis:**
   
   - Compute the total layoffs per country to see the global distribution.
  
   ```sql
   SELECT country, SUM(total_laid_off)
   FROM layoffs_staging2
   GROUP BY country
   ORDER BY 2 DESC;
   ```

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2460e9f-7d4e-4852-8faa-20e285e54304)
   

5. **üìÜ Temporal Analysis:**
     
   - Analyze the timeline of layoffs by extracting the year and month from date fields.
  
   ```sql
   SELECT YEAR(`date`), SUM(total_laid_off)
   FROM layoffs_staging2
   WHERE YEAR(`date`) IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY YEAR(`date`)
   ORDER BY 1 DESC;
   ```

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f66fc7e8-ca90-4f33-8255-1b3b712dc5b9)


   - Use rolling totals to observe trends over months and identify the peak periods.

   ```sql
   WITH Rolling_Total AS
   (
   	SELECT SUBSTRING(`date`, 1, 7) AS `MONTH`, SUM(total_laid_off) AS total_off
	FROM layoffs_staging2
	WHERE SUBSTRING(`date`, 1, 7) IS NOT NULL
	GROUP BY `MONTH`
	ORDER BY 1 ASC
   )
   SELECT `MONTH`, total_off, SUM(total_off) OVER(ORDER BY `MONTH`) AS rolling_total 
   FROM Rolling_Total;
   ```

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/937ade30-e290-490f-9cc7-4066f7370197)


   - Implement window functions like `SUM() OVER (ORDER BY month)` to calculate cumulative totals.

   ```sql
   WITH Rolling_Total AS
	(
	SELECT SUBSTRING(`date`, 1, 7) AS `MONTH`, SUM(total_laid_off) AS total_off
	FROM layoffs_staging2
	WHERE SUBSTRING(`date`, 1, 7) IS NOT NULL
	GROUP BY `MONTH`
	ORDER BY 1 ASC
	)
   SELECT `MONTH`, total_off, SUM(total_off) OVER(ORDER BY `MONTH`) AS rolling_total 
   FROM Rolling_Total;
   ```

6. **üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Analysis:**
    
   - Leverage ranking functions like `DENSE_RANK()` to determine yearly leaders.

   ```sql
   WITH Company_Year (company, years, total_laid_off) AS
	(
	SELECT company, YEAR(`date`), SUM(total_laid_off)
	FROM layoffs_staging2
	GROUP BY company, YEAR(`date`)
	)
   SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY years ORDER BY total_laid_off DESC) AS Ranking
   FROM Company_Year
   WHERE years IS NOT NULL
   ORDER BY Ranking ASC;
   ```

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee26e7ca-4450-4b42-8ee1-48cc467a2a03)

   - Filter top companies per year to assess shifting trends over time.

   ```sql
   WITH Company_Year (company, years, total_laid_off) AS
	(
	SELECT company, YEAR(`date`), SUM(total_laid_off)
	FROM layoffs_staging2
	GROUP BY company, YEAR(`date`)
	), Company_Year_Rank AS
	(
	SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY years ORDER BY total_laid_off DESC) AS Ranking
	FROM Company_Year
	WHERE years IS NOT NULL
	)
   SELECT *
   FROM Company_Year_Rank
   WHERE Ranking <= 5;
   ```
